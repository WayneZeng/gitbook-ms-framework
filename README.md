Microservice is a tiny, loosely coupled distributed service.   Each microservice can scale independently via X-axis scaling (cloning with more CPU or memory) and Z-axis scaling (sharding), based upn their needs.  Are you ready for a simple and neat way to know microservices?  Hopefully, this list will help you with making desisions and save some time.
